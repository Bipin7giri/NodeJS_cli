# NodeJS CLI - API Endpoint Generator

## Overview

Welcome to the NodeJS CLI - a powerful tool designed to simplify the process of creating API endpoints in Node.js applications. This CLI automates the generation of endpoints, including GET, POST, PUT, and PATCH methods, along with essential components like controllers, routers, and services.

## Features

- Generate API endpoints quickly and effortlessly.
- Support for GET, POST, PUT, and PATCH methods.
- Automatic setup of controllers, routers, and services.
- Boost your development efficiency by reducing manual configuration.

## Getting Started

Sure, here's how you can create a `README.md` for your npm package and demonstrate the usage in a separate script:

1. **Create README.md**:

In the root directory of your package, create a `README.md` file. This file will contain information about your package, its usage, and any other relevant details. Here's a basic example:

```markdown
# Express Boilerplate CLI

This package provides a CLI tool to generate Express.js boilerplate code.

## Installation

You can install the package using npm:

```sh
npm install express_boilerplate_cli
```

## Usage

To use the CLI tool, create a JavaScript file (e.g., `script.js`) and add the following code:

```javascript
import { ExpressCLI } from "express_boilerplate_cli";

const main = async () => {
  await ExpressCLI();
};

main();
```

Run the script using:

```sh
node script.js
```

This will generate Express.js boilerplate code in your project directory.

2. **Usage Script**:

Create a JavaScript file named `script.js` (or any other name you prefer) in the same directory where you have your `package.json`. Add the following code to the `script.js` file:

```javascript
import { ExpressCLI } from "express_boilerplate_cli";

const main = async () => {
  await ExpressCLI();
};

main();
```

3. **Run the Script**:

Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you have your `script.js` file. Run the script using the following command:

```sh
node script.js
```

This will execute the `ExpressCLI` function from your package and generate the Express.js boilerplate code.
